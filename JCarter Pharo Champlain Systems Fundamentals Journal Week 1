Number systems are ways that we represent data, humans primarily use base 10, meaning there are ten symbols with different values, if you want to represent more then
ten values you must use more then one symbol. Computers use binary, which is a base two number system, it represents data through either a 0 or a 1, so if you wanted
to represent 2 from base ten, you would write 10, so you have a 1 in the twos place and a 0 in the ones place. Another common number system is Hexadecimal,
which uses base sixteen, it uses the 0-9 symbols from base ten and also the letters a-f to represent 11-16 in base ten, if you wanted to represent the number 15 in
hexadecimal, you would only write 'F', if you wanted to represent 17 from base ten in hexadecimal, you would write 11.
